# RDG Frontend Test Project
Test project for potential frontend designer/developer hires.

This project is intended to evaluate your interpretation of a provided design to front-end code. We will be looking not only at what the end result looks like in the browser and in the code, but also your initiative to learn new things and go above and beyond the minimum requirements.

## Directions
You have been provided with desktop and mobile mockups for a web page, along with the HTML of said page. It is your job to build the responsive styling according to the mockups. You may not edit the HTML other than the `<head>` section or to add scripts, but are free to devise your own file structure. You may choose to use CSS, SASS, or another language to execute the styles, along with JQuery, Javascript, and other libraries to achieve functional behaviors. You will have one week to complete this task, at which point you will turn in your work for review.


### Functional Requirements
1. Responsive: must be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop. You may interpret tablet layout and breakpoints as you see fit.
2. Mobile Menu: must be able to toggle open and closed.
3. Hero Slider: must be functional and responsive, and have navigation arrows. You may use a JS plugin or library to accomplish this.


## Tips, Notes, and Guidelines

### Getting the Repository
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone it onto your machine
3. Make a new branch, using the naming convention first initial_lastname (ex. John Smith --> j_smith)
4. Complete the required styling and functionality adding, committing, and pushing your changes to your forked branch.
5. Pull request back to the `rdg-frontent-test` repository

### JQuery ###
JQuery can be pulled into the site in two ways. You can download JQuery and link it from your internal file structure, or pull it in using an external link.

- CDN: https://code.jquery.com/

### SASS ### 
At RDG, we use SASS for our styling instead of CSS. This allows us greater flexibility by nesting and variables, and ultimately using fewer lines of code by way of mixins. If you decide to use SASS as your styling language of choice (but it's completely new to you), here are some links to help you get started.
